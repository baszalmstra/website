After the [release of Mun v0.3][v3r] we are now looking at new features for the Mun v0.4 release. 
The biggest of which will be support for dynamically sized arrays.

#### Mun v0.3

This month was highlighted by the release of Mun v0.3. 
This release has take us quite some time but we finally managed to put the finishing touches to the third release of Mun. 
Mun v0.3 adds support for modules & multi-file projects, a functioning language server which features autocompletion and a lot more. 
The [Mun v0.3 release blog][v3r] highlights all of the new features packed in this release.

#### Mun v0.4

Mun v0.4 will be the next release of the Mun programming language. 
We expected to release Mun v0.3 within a few months of Mun v0.2 but this was pushed back a couple of times because we added more and more features to the release. 
We concluded that the next time around we will try to create smaller increments with less features so we are (hopefully) able to release faster and more often. As it stands the [Mun v0.4 milestone][v4m] is a lot smaller than our original Mun v0.3 milestone.

* **[RFC] dynamically sized arrays** [[PR#324]](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/pull/324)

  The next big feature for Mun will be support for arrays.
 
  To gather feedback and get everyone on the same page we opened an RFC pull request where we encourage everyone to comment on our design choices with regards to array support.

  We hope to merge this RFC soon so we can get to work on the actual development process of this long-awaited feature.

Interested in our progress or what we are doing next?
Please check out our [milestone page](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/milestones) on Github that details new features for future releases - Mun v0.4 and v0.5 - as well as a backlog of features that are still to come.
